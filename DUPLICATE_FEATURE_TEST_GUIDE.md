2. Frontend running: `http://localhost:5173`
3. Authenticated user in frontend

### **Test Scenario 1: Basic Duplicate**

1. Navigate to `/campaigns` page
2. Create a new test campaign:
   - Name: "Original Campaign"
   - Template: Any template
   - Domain: punthelder-marketing.nl

- ✅ Toast description: "Created: Original Campaign (Copy)"
- ✅ Redirect to new campaign detail page
- ✅ New campaign appears in campaigns list
- ✅ New campaign has status "Draft"
- ✅ New campaign name = "{original name} (Copy)"

1. Create campaign with audience through wizard:
   - Select leads in Leads tab
   - Click "Create Campaign"
   - Complete wizard with selected leads
2. On campaigns page, duplicate the campaign
3. View the duplicated campaign

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ All KPI counters reset to 0
- ✅ Start date is null/empty

### **Test Scenario 3: Duplicate Running Campaign**

3. Duplicate the running campaign

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Original campaign continues running
- ✅ Duplicate has status "Draft"
- ✅ Duplicate has sent_count = 0
- ✅ No messages copied to duplicate
- ✅ Follow-up settings preserved

### **Test Scenario 4: Error Handling**

**Test 4a: Duplicate Non-existent Campaign**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/campaigns/fake-id/duplicate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```
**Expected**: 404 Not Found

**Test 4b: Duplicate Without Auth**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/campaigns/any-id/duplicate
```
**Expected**: 401 Unauthorized

## 🔍 **BACKEND VERIFICATION**

### **Check Store State:**

```python
# In Python console or test
from app.services.campaign_store import campaign_store

# List all campaigns
campaigns = list(campaign_store.campaigns.values())
print(f"Total campaigns: {len(campaigns)}")

# Check for duplicates (should have '(Copy)' in name)
duplicates = [c for c in campaigns if '(Copy)' in c.name]
print(f"Duplicated campaigns: {len(duplicates)}")

# Verify audience copied
for campaign in duplicates:
    audiences = [a for a in campaign_store.audiences.values() 
                 if a.campaign_id == campaign.id]
    if audiences:
        print(f"Campaign {campaign.id} has {len(audiences[0].lead_ids)} leads")
```
